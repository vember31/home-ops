## üìñ Overview

This is a mono repository for my home infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster. This follows Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) and [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate).

## ‚õµ Kubernetes

There is a template over at [onedr0p/flux-cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template) if you want to try and follow along with some of the practices in use here.

### Installation

This cluster is [k3s](https://k3s.io/) provisioned atop Ubuntu 22.04 VMs, which are hosted in Proxmox v8. This is a semi-hyper-converged cluster, where workloads and block storage share the same available resources on nodes.  Two of the nodes also run OpenMediaVault, utilizing XFS & MergerFS as file systems, and serve NFS, SMB, S3 (via [MinIO](https://min.io)) and provide bulk file storage and Longhorn backups. These bulk storage drives are backed up via SnapRAID on a weekly schedule.

### Core Components

- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/): manages SSL X509 certificates for all http-based services
- [cloudnative-pg](https://cloudnative-pg.io): high-availability PostgreSQL database built for Kubernetes
- [eraser](https://github.com/eraser-dev/eraser): removes non-running images from all nodes
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): automatically syncs DNS records from cluster ingresses to a DNS provider (Cloudflare)
- [external-secrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/): managed Kubernetes secrets using Gitlab CI/CD variables
- [kured](https://github.com/kubereboot/kured): Kubernetes daemonset that performs safe automatic node reboots when the need to do so is indicated by the package management system of the underlying OS
- [kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus): Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager & Thanos, bundled into one helm chart for high-availability observability & monitoring
- [longhorn](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn): distributed block storage for Kubernetes volume persistence
- [metal-lb](https://github.com/metallb/metallb): internal Kubernetes load-balancing plugin
- [system-upgrade-controller](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller): automated, rolling k3s version upgrades
- [traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik): ingress controller for Kubernetes, acting as a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches the cluster defined in the [kubernetes](./kubernetes/) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to the cluster based on the state of this Git repository.

Flux works by recursively searching the `kubernetes/apps` folder until it finds the most top-level `kustomization.yaml` per directory, and then applies all resources listed in it. That aforementioned `kustomization.yaml` will generally have a namespace resource and one or many Flux kustomizations (`ks.yaml`). Under the control of those Flux kustomizations there will be a `HelmRelease` or other resources related to the application which will be applied.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches the **entire** repository looking for dependency updates. When updates are found, PRs are automatically created. Flux applies the changes to the cluster once PRs are merged.

### Directories

This Git repository contains the following directories under [Kubernetes](./kubernetes/).

```sh
üìÅ kubernetes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ apps           # applications
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ bootstrap      # bootstrap procedures
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ flux           # core flux configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ templates      # re-useable components
```

### Flux Workflow

This is a high-level look how Flux deploys applications with dependencies. Below there are 3 example apps: `postgres`, `lldap` and `authelia`. `postgres` is the first app that needs to be running and healthy before `lldap` and `authelia`. Once `postgres` is healthy `lldap` will be deployed and after that is healthy `authelia` will be deployed.

```

## üåê DNS

A UDM Pro SE is the center of the network. DHCP leases point to [Blocky](https://github.com/0xERR0R/blocky) as the primary DNS and [AdGuard Home](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome) as secondary. Blocky is hosted within the Kubernetes cluster as a daemonset for high availability across 4 nodes (5 VMs), and AdGuard Home is hosted in an LXC container on one of the nodes. MetalLB announces these routes via BGP to achieve true high-availability for clients to have direct routes to each node. A spare Raspberry Pi is available for further redundancy.

Blocky / AdGuard Home reoslve all local (`*.local.${SECRET_DOMAIN}`) DNS entries to Traefik (reverse proxy), which directs to the appropriate ingress. All forwarded DNS queries that leave the cluster are sent via DoT to Cloudflare.
